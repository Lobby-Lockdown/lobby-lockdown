# 🎮 Lobby Lockdown

**Lobby Lockdown** is a community-driven ban list tool designed for the game **Lockdown Protocol** on Steam. It helps players host cleaner, more enjoyable lobbies by allowing them to maintain and share banned players and edit their ban lists outside of the game, since the game doesn't allow that currently. The project includes utilities for managing ban lists, as well as syncing lists from external sources.
